# NAYOS: Network Architecture Yielding Orchestrator Sampler

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT EVEN A DRAFT YET, DO NOT USE**


## OVERVIEW

**NAYOS (Network Architecture Yielding Orchestrator Sampler) is a testing and examination tool desgined to help with kuberntes network architecure evaluation and optimization. NAYOS is designed for multi-cluster setups in mind, where NAYOS is deployed simutaneously across two or more clusters to analyze and validate network configurations, load balancing strategies and ingress controllers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of NAYOS is to facilitate the examination and testing of complex network setups in container orchestration environments. NAYOS is designed to provide insights into:

- **Multi-Cluster Network Architecture:** Evaluate and test how applications perform across multiple k8s clusters.
- **Load Balancer COnfiguration:** Analyze the behabior of different load balancing strategies.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Track and visualize e2e network traffic, including traces from fronted UI, API backend and DB interactions.
- **Resilience and Performance Testing:** Test relability and performance of network architectures under various conditions, heloing identify potential bottlenecks and optimize configurations.
